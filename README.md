PRODUCT TRACkER:

Created by: Iowa State Senior Design Team sdmay20-02 (Ryan Connolly, Nathan Shull, Nathan Yasosky
Jamie Raught, Tyler Kreuger, Clayton Nida)

Project Overview:
Product TRACkER will serve as an internal application to be used by employees of Collins 
Aerospace. At Collins they have roadmaps, which are timelines of a product's life showing 
redesigns and projected end of production and end of service dates. These roadmaps are 
currently maintained in spreadsheets or slides. The data is not widely available to 
programs/pursuits or contracts, leading to pursuits choosing equipment that may not fit their 
needs, programs unaware of pending end of production, or products ending production/service in 
violation of contract requirements.

Project Goal:
The goal of our application is to provide an intuitive and easy to use application to solve 
the above problems. Product TRACkER is an electronic database used to store product roadmaps 
and contracts data.
